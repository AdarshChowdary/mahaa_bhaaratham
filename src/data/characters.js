He is the eldest among the five Pandavas, and is also one of the central characters of the epic. Yudhistara was the son of Kunti, the first wife of King Pandu, fathered by the god Yama due to Pandu's inability to have children. Yudhistara held a belief in dharma (morals and virtues) and was chosen to be the crown prince of Kuru. But after the Lakshagriha incident, he was presumed to be dead and his cousin Duryodhana was appointed as the new heir. The kingdom was split in half due to a succession dispute between Yudhistara and Duryodhana. Yudhistara received the barren half, which he later transformed into the magnificent city of Indraprastha.",
